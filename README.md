Things I have enhanced in my new js code:

1- In previous code script.js, I tended to put all the DOM radomly and globally,
but I have fixed that by creating an organized object, which will facilitate navigation.
2- The "validateForm" function did a lot and used many repeated code. For instance, I checked
each line seperatly whether it validates or not. On the fixed version, I personalized a function
for that specific purpose, which helps in reusability. I used conditional in each line so as not to make 
all the other elements fire simultaneously which might lead a all sections being red in the UI.
3- I created a function that is called with the submit and shows every lasting unvalidated field.
 

Besides, I have aimed for writing a clean, useful, and maintainable code!
